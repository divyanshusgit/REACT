WHAT IS CROSS ORIGIN IN THE SCRIPT TAG?
- refers to the loading of JavaScript resources from a different domain
- Web browsers enforce a security feature known as the "same-origin policy" to prevent potentially harmful interactions between documents from different origins.
- cross origin="anonymous"
  - The browser makes a cross-origin request without including any credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication).
  - this is suitable for scenarios where the resource being loaded doesn't require authentication or where you want to ensure that no sensitive information is sent with the request.
- cross origin="use-credentials"
  - The browser makes a cross-origin request and includes credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) with the request.
  - This is used when the resource being loaded requires authentication.
- skipping cross origin request
  - if you omit the cross origin attribute altogether, the browser defaults to treating the request as if it were same-origin, meaning it won't include credentials with the request.
