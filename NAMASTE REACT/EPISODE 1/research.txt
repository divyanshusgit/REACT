REACT
-----
- React is an open-source JavaScript LIBRARY.
- used for building user interfaces and UI components
- key features of react are: component based architecture, virtual DOM, JSX, unidirectional data flow (flow of data from parent component to child component)










-------
LIBRARY
-------
- is a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can use to perform common tasks.
- it simplifies the development process by providing reusable components and functions to the developers.










-----------------------------------
JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS
-----------------------------------

- jQuery is a JavaScript library
- React JS is a JavaScript library
- Vue.js is a JavaScript framework
- Angular is a JavaScript framework
- D3.js is a JavaScript library

- jQuery (library)
  - for simplifying DOM manipulations
  - for simplifying AJAX requests
  - for simplifying event handling

- React (library)
  - used for building user interfaces
  - with a component based architecture
  - focuses on efficient rendering and state management

- Vue.js (framework)
  - not understood

- Angular (framework)
  - not understood

- D3.js (library)
  - for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations
  - using HTML, SVG, and CSS










--------------------------------------
DOES THE BROWSER UNDERSTAND REACT CODE
--------------------------------------
- the browser doesn't understand react code
- react code is written in JSX
- jsx is not natively supported by browsers
- tools like BABEL transpile jsx and other ECMASCRIPT features into plain JavaScript that browse can understand

WAYS TO GET REACT INTO OUR PROJECT
----------------------------------
- using CDN LINKS
- downloading REACT and REACT DOM locally from the website
- using NPM or YARN (whatever you are using)
- using CREATE REACT APP










---------
CDN LINKS
---------
- cdn stands for content delivery network
- is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver web content
- CDN offers several benefits, including faster loading times, improved performance, and reduced server load
- CDNs often have multiple servers distributed globally, allowing users to download the library from a server closer to their location, improving download speeds










-----------------------------
ADVANTAGES OF USING CDN LINKS 
-----------------------------
- faster loading time
  - resources are fetched from the nearest located server
- improved website performance
  - CDNs offload the delivery of static assets, reducing the load on our origin server 
- reduce bandwidth costs
  - not understood
- caching
  - CDNs use caching mechanisms to store copies of static resources at edge locations. This reduces the need to repeatedly fetch the same resources from the origin server, further improving performance.
- global reach
  - CDNs have servers in multiple geographic locations, allowing your content to be delivered quickly to users around the world.
- load balancing
  - CDNs often use load balancing techniques to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming overwhelmed.










--------------------------------
DISADVANTAGES OF USING CDN LINKS
--------------------------------
- Dependency on Third-Party Service
  - Using a CDN means relying on a third-party service. If the CDN experiences downtime or issues, it could impact the availability of your resources.
- costs
  - While CDNs can reduce bandwidth costs, using a premium CDN service may come with associated costs. 
- Limited Control
  - When using a CDN, you have less control over the configuration and management of the servers delivering your content. Advanced configurations may require cooperation with the CDN provider.
- Potential Security Risks
  - because it's a third party service
  - so choose a reputable CDN and stay updated about security best practices










---------------
REACT CDN LINKS
---------------
- those react cdn links point to files with .js extension (they contain JavaScript code)
- bts of using react cdn links:
  - we get access to react library directly from global network of servers, without the need of local installation











----------------------------
DOM MANIPULATIONS ARE COSTLY
----------------------------
- making frequent changes to the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page can have performance implications. 
- The DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text content.
- manipulating DOM means making changes on the tree structure. Operations like adding, removing, or modifying elements can trigger the browser to re-render parts of the page, recalculate styles, and potentially trigger layout and paint operations. These operations are computationally expensive and can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large or complex web pages.
