REACT.CRATEELEMENT v/s JSX
- both are used to create react elements
- but jsx is more readable and concise
- JSX is just syntactic sugar, it get's converted to React.createElement call during the build process

COMPONENT COMPOSITION
- refers to the practice of building complex user interfaces by combining or nesting smaller, reusable components
- instead of creating one monolithic and large component to handle all aspects of a user interface, you break down the UI into smaller, more manageable pieces, each responsible for a specific functionality or visual representation

<COMP></COMP> v/s <COMP/> v/s COMP()
- first and second are standard way (JSX syntax)
- we can use <comp/> if our component doesn't have any children
- compName() is also valid way, but it is not jsx
