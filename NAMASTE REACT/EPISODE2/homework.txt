WHAT IS TREE SHAKING?
- It is used to eliminate dead (unused) code from your final bundled JavaScript output.
- The goal is to reduce the size of your JavaScript bundles by excluding parts of the code that are not actually being used in your application.
- This helps improve the overall performance of your web application by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed by the browser.

WHAT IS HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT?

- Instead of reloading the entire page, HMR replaces, adds, or removes modules that have been modified, providing a more seamless and faster development experience.

WHY SHOULD I NOT MODIFY THE PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON?
