initializing node js project using npm init (getting the package.json file)
installing parcel as dev dependency (getting package-lock.json file and the node_modules folder)
installing react and react dom
commenting cdn links, setting the script's type to module, importing react and reactdom and using createElement, createRoot and render functions.

NPM (the default package manager of node.js which helps use manage dependencies)

NPM registry (NPM's centralized repository)

Packages (collection of JavaScript files which make our work easier) (are highly encapsulated)

Dependencies (the packages on which our project depends)

running npm install after cloning will install the required dependencies

Node.js (the open source, cross platformed JavaScript runtime environment build on the Chrome's V8 engine)

What is open source software?

What is a cross Platform software?

What is runtime environment? Name some JavaScript runtime?

What is JavaScript engine?

npm init command to initiate a node.js project (creates the package.json file)

package.json file (created after npm init) (high level configuration file, contains metadata) (high level tracking) (edited by developer)

package-lock.json (created after installing dependencies) (for building deterministic builds) (detailed tracking) (automatically updated by npm)

package.json file guides package-lock.json resolves

what is bundler? what does it do? (primary purpose: bundle/package our project) (by: module bundling, dependency management, code transformation, asset management, code splitting, minification, uglification, optimizations, development and production builds)

Development Phase (writing, testing, refining functionality) (less emphasis of optimizations) (on local machines)

Production Phase (deployment phase) 

-D flag

node modules folder (put in gitignore) (contain the code of direct and indirect/transitive dependencies) (can be regenerated using package.json and package-lock.json file)

dist folder (put in git ignore) (contains the bundle/optimized code to be pushed to be deployed)

.parcel-cache file (put in git ignore) (speeds up the build process by preventing re-rendering) (machine specific)

bts of npx parcel index.html

how npx executes the package without installing it?
