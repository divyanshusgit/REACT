WHAT IS NPX?
- npx is a package manager tool which comes with the npm package manager and it is used to executed the node.js packages
- npm simplifies the use of npm packages by allowing you to execute commands without the need for global installations
- when we run a npx parcel index.html command 
  - npx checks if parcel-bundler is already installed locally in our project's node_modules folder
  - if it doesn't found it there, it will install the parcel-bundler locally into the node_modules folder
  - npx runs the specified command 
  - after the command completes the parcel-bundler is discarded

WHAT IS TREE SHAKING?
- It is used to eliminate dead (unused) code from your final bundled JavaScript output.
- The goal is to reduce the size of your JavaScript bundles by excluding parts of the code that are not actually being used in your application.
- This helps improve the overall performance of your web application by reducing the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and executed by the browser.

WHAT IS HOT MODULE REPLACEMENT?
- It is a feature that allows developers to update modules in an application without a full page refresh.
- Instead of reloading the entire page, HMR replaces, adds, or removes modules that have been modified, providing a more seamless and faster development experience.

WHY SHOULD I NOT MODIFY THE PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON?
- It is automatically managed by npm. Manually modifying it could lead to inconsistencies and conflicts with the actual state of your project's dependencies.
