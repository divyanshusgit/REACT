-----
REACT
-----
- React is an open-source JavaScript LIBRARY, it is used for building user interfaces and UI components. - Main features of react: Component based architecture, virtual DOM, JSX and  unidirectional data flow. 










------------------------
UNIDIRECTIONAL DATA FLOW
------------------------
- movement of data occurs in a single, consistent direction throughout the application is called unidirectional flow of data.










-------
LIBRARY
-------
- It is a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can use to perform common tasks. It simplifies the development process by providing reusable components and functions to the developers.




---------
FRAMEWORK
---------
- It is a pre-established and reusable set of tools, libraries, conventions and best practices which provide a structured foundation for building web applications  





---------------------
LIBRARY v/s FRAMEWORK
---------------------
- Libraries provide a collection of pre-written code or functions. Frameworks provide a pre-established structure for building web applications.
- Libraries don't dictate the overall structure or flow of our application. But frameworks do.
- Libraries are usually flexible. But frameworks aren't. 
- Libraries are typically smaller in size while framework are typically larger in size.
- Libraries have lower learning curve. Frameworks have higher learning curve.









-----------------------------------
JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES AND FRAMEWORKS
-----------------------------------

- jQuery is a JavaScript library
- React JS is a JavaScript library
- Vue.js is a JavaScript framework
- Angular is a JavaScript framework
- D3.js is a JavaScript library

- jQuery (library)
  - for simplifying DOM manipulations
  - for simplifying AJAX requests
  - for simplifying event handling

- React (library)
  - used for building user interfaces
  - with a component based architecture
  - focuses on efficient rendering and state management

- Vue.js (framework)
  - not understood

- Angular (framework)
  - not understood

- D3.js (library)
  - for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations
  - using HTML, SVG, and CSS










--------------------------------------
DOES THE BROWSER UNDERSTAND REACT CODE
--------------------------------------
- Browsers don't understand react code, because react code is generally written in JSX, which is not natively supported by browsers.
- Tools like BABEL transpile jsx and other ECMASCRIPT features into plain JavaScript that browsers can understand .










----------------------------------
WAYS TO GET REACT INTO OUR PROJECT
----------------------------------
- using CDN LINKS
- using NPM or YARN (whatever you are using)
- using CREATE REACT APP










---------
CDN LINKS
---------
- CDN or content delivery network is a system of distributed servers that work together to deliver web content.










-----------------------------
ADVANTAGES OF USING CDN LINKS 
-----------------------------
- faster loading time
  - since resources are fetched from the nearest located server
- improved website performance
  - the delivery of static assets is offloaded, so the load on the origin server reduces and websites performance is improved 
- global reach
  - content is easily delivered to all the users globally, because servers are located at multiple geographic locations
- load balancing
  - incoming traffic is distributed across different servers by load balancing techniques, preventing overwhelming load on a single servers.










--------------------------------
DISADVANTAGES OF USING CDN LINKS
--------------------------------
- Risk of unavailability of resources
  - if CDN links experience downtime or issues
- premium CDN services are costly 
- Limited Control over configuration and management servers
  - because servers come under to responsibility of CDN service providers.
  - additional configurations on server would require cooperation with CDN service providers. 
- Security Risks
  - because CDN are third party services 
- So choose a reputable CDN and stay updated about security best practices.









---------------
REACT CDN LINKS
---------------
- those react cdn links point to JavaScript files 
- We get access to react library directly from global network of servers, without the need of local installation











----------------------------
DOM MANIPULATIONS ARE COSTLY
----------------------------
- making frequent changes to the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page can have performance implications. 
- The DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as elements, attributes, and text content.
- manipulating DOM means making changes on the tree structure. Operations like adding, removing, or modifying elements can trigger the browser to re-render parts of the page, recalculate styles, and potentially trigger layout and paint operations. These operations are computationally expensive and can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large or complex web pages.
